This work presents a theological thesis template based on the Reformed tradition and the academic standards required by confessional seminaries. The proposal aims to offer a clear and commented structure, including examples of sections such as introduction, development, and conclusion, as well as guidance on ABNT formatting, citations, glossary usage, and appropriate language for both pastoral and academic contexts. The model seeks to assist seminarians in the preparation of their papers, upholding biblical and confessional faithfulness while recognizing the formal requirements that turn theology into numbered pages. The methodology used is bibliographic and illustrative, with a discreet touch of humor to preserve the reader's sanity. This template does not replace pastoral or academic supervision but intends to serve as a helpful tool for those wandering in the valley of the thesis.
